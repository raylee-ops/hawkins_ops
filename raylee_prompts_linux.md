# LINUX MINT SETUP PROMPTS

## Machine: Linux Mint Mini (Daily Runner)
## Run this after completing all Windows prompts

---

## PROMPT 10 — Create Autologging Skeleton (Git + Labs)

```
You are CLAUDE CODE.

TASK:
Create a new folder on this machine:
~/autolog/

Inside it, create two empty Python files:

- autolog_git.py
- autolog_labs.py

Each file should have:
print("placeholder: autologger created")

No logic yet.
These will later integrate with progress.db.
```

---

## WHAT YOU NOW HAVE

### On Windows (Build Machine):
* Progress tracker database (`progress.db`)
* Progress CLI tool (`progress.py`)
* Full documentation pack (5 markdown files)

### On Linux Mint (Daily Runner):
* Autologging skeleton ready for future integration

---

## NEXT STEPS (AFTER THIS SESSION)

### Immediate:
1. Test `progress.py` on Windows:
   ```bash
   python progress.py log
   python progress.py summary
   ```

2. Copy `progress.db` and `progress.py` to Linux Mint for daily use

### Future Sessions:
1. Build HTML dashboard exporter
2. Implement autolog_git.py (track commits)
3. Implement autolog_labs.py (track lab completions)
4. Create cron jobs for automatic logging
5. Build terminal dashboard viewer

## PORTFOLIO READY

Your `docs_pack` folder is now portfolio-ready:

* Show it in interviews
* Reference it in your resume
* Use it as proof of systems thinking
* Demonstrate automation + documentation skills

This setup **proves** you can:
* Build systems from scratch
* Automate personal workflows
* Document complex architectures
* Think like an engineer, not just a script-runner

## SESSION COMPLETE

You've now built:
✔ Personal progress tracking system
✔ Documentation pack for your cybersecurity journey
✔ Foundation for automated logging
✔ Real portfolio material

**Total time investment:** ~2 hours
**Career ROI:** Incalculable

Keep building. Keep tracking. Keep moving forward.
